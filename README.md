**Build, manage, and scale machine learning workloads seamlessly using Google's TensorFlow Enterprise**

## What is this book about?
TensorFlow as a machine learning (ML) library has matured into a production-ready ecosystem. This beginner’s book uses practical examples to enable you to build and deploy TensorFlow models using optimal settings that ensure long-term support without having to worry about library deprecation or being left behind when it comes to bug fixes or workarounds.

The book begins by showing you how to refine your TensorFlow project and set it up for enterprise-level deployment. You’ll then learn how to choose a future-proof version of TensorFlow. As you advance, you’ll find out how to build and deploy models in a robust and stable environment by following recommended practices made available in TensorFlow Enterprise. This book also teaches you how to manage your services better and enhance the performance and reliability of your artificial intelligence (AI) applications. You’ll discover how to use various enterprise-ready services to accelerate your ML and AI workflows on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Finally, you’ll scale your ML models and handle heavy workloads across CPUs, GPUs, and Cloud TPUs.

By the end of this TensorFlow book, you’ll have learned the patterns needed for TensorFlow Enterprise model development, data pipelines, training, and deployment.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Discover how to set up a GCP TensorFlow Enterprise cloud instance and environment
* Handle and format raw data that can be consumed by the TensorFlow model training process
* Develop ML models and leverage prebuilt models using the TensorFlow Enterprise API
* Use distributed training strategies and implement hyperparameter tuning to scale and improve your model training experiments
* Scale the training process by using GPU and TPU clusters
* Adopt the latest model optimization techniques and deployment methodologies to improve model efficiency

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
p2 = Person()
p2.name = 'Jane'
p2.age = 20
print(p2.name)
print(p2.age)

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists, machine learning developers or engineers, and cloud practitioners who want to learn and implement various services and features offered by TensorFlow Enterprise from scratch. Basic knowledge of the machine learning development process will be useful.

It would be very helpful to have a fundamental understanding of, and experience with, the Keras API, as this book pivots on a TensorFlow version beyond 2.x, in which the Keras API is offi cially supported and adopted as the tf.keras API. In addition, having a basic understanding of image classifi cation techniques (convolution, and multiclass classification) would be helpful, as this book reuses the image classifi cation problem as a vehicle to introduce and explain new features in TensorFlow Enterprise 2. Another helpful tool is GitHub. Basic experience with cloning GitHub repositories and navigating file structures would be very helpful for downloading the source code in this book.

From the ML perspective, having a basic understanding of model architectures, feature engineering processes, and hyperparameter optimization would be helpful. It is also assumed that you are familiar with fundamental Python data structures, including NumPy arrays, tuples, and dictionaries.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
