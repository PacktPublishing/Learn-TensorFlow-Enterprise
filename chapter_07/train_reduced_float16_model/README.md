## Reduced-Float16 quantization

In this module, a Jupyter notebook is provided to cover the folloowing topics:

1. Comparing model size.
2. Convert a full model into Reduced Float16 TFLite model.
3. Compare accuracy in scoring test data by TFLite and original model.

`tflite_rf16_model` folder is created as the result of successful conversion of original model to TFLite model.
