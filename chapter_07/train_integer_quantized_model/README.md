## Integer quantization

In this module, a Jupyter notebook is provided to cover the folloowing topics:

1. Show TFLite model size.
2. Convert a full model into integer quantization TFLite model.
3. Measure in scoring test data by TFLite.

`tflite_integer_model` folder is created as the result of successful conversion of original model to TFLite model.
